            <p>I was raised in a modest family. When I turned 18 I joined the marines and eventually the special forces. Years later after my tours were up, I became a drifter and as such drifted through many places.  One small town was different from the rest. It was real small.  I was just passing through; didn't even want to stop. A sheriff approached me and told me to turn around and leave.  I didn't want any trouble and thats what I told him.  He tried to arrest me and I resisted. We fought but he had a gun. After I was taken in I managed to escape custody and steal a few guns. My survival instinct set in and I fled in to the forrest where I constructed various traps.  The police came in after me but were not aware of my skill set. I hurt a lot of cops that day.  My old seargent came in and convinced the cops to let me go. Is this what life is like when you get out of the shit, man?  Is this how the world treats veterans now?</p>
